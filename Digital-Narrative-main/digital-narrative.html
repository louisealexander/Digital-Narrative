                    <p>Margaret and Frances Macdonald were two key pioneers of the Art Nouveau Movement who sought to transgress against the restrictions of the 18th century, emerging into a new century full of hope for liberation, both artistically and sexually.
                        In 1890, both sisters registered to enter the Glasgow School of Art, where they met Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Herbert MacNair, and would go on to create the infamous ‘Glasgow Four’ artistic collective, particularly distorting and challenging female representation. Eventually Margaret married Charles and Frances married Herbert.

                    <p>The Vienna Succession was a movement catalyzed by a break with the academic style in Vienna in 1897, where the ‘Glasgow Four’s’ work was well received. Despite Margaret’s success in Vienna, her work was greatly criticized and overshadowed by Charles’ legacy.
